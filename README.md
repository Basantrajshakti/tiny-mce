# React Vite App with Self-Hosted TinyMCE

This is a React application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) that demonstrates how to implement a self-hosted [TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/) rich text editor. This example is designed for personal use and effective testing of TinyMCE features within a React environment.

## Features

- **React 18**: Built with the latest version of React for efficient UI rendering.
- **Vite**: Powered by Vite for fast development and building.
- **Self-Hosted TinyMCE**: Integrates TinyMCE directly into the application, giving you full control over the editor's assets and version.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (if applicable) or navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in your terminal).

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

To preview the production build:
